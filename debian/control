Architecture: all
Depends: ant-optional, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Analysing tool for Java dependencies
 Classycle's Analyser analyses the static class and package dependencies
 in Java applications or libraries. It is especially helpful for finding cyclic
 dependencies between classes or packages.
 .
 Classycle is similar to JDepend which does also a dependency analysis
 but only on the package level.
 .
 Classycle's Dependency Checker searches for unwanted class dependencies
 described in a dependency definition file. Dependency checking helps to
 monitor whether certain architectural constrains (e.g. in a layered
 architecture) are fulfilled or not.
